# What is Heroku Flask Template ?
`version 1.1`

Heroku Flask Template is a simple web app programmed in Python-3 using flask micro-framework. It is created for begginers to understand the basics of creating a flask web app and deploying it on the Heroku. It can also be used as a template to create your new flask web apps which can then easily be deployable on Heroku.

## Language, Framework and Plugins used :
- ### Python 3.6.2
- ### Flask micro-framework
- ### Heroku

## How to use the Heroku Flask Template ?
- ### Download or clone this template.
- ### Add your web-pages in the `templates` folder.
- ### Edit `main.py` to add new routes and render the web-pages.
- ### Add all the extra plugins that you used in the `requirements.txt`.
- ### Push it to the Heroku server and deploy.

## Why I created this template ?
I tried to deploy several of my python applications to Heroku. But it was a disaster to find out so many flaws. There were so many tutorials yet it takes so much time to figure things out, thus once I sucessfully deployed my first flask app on Heroku I decided to upload it on GitHub so that everyone can use it ! 

## License and Usage :

This project is completely open-source and free-to-use. But you will need to mention about its great, super awesome author XD (JK, use it anywhere you want, I really don't care.) PS, Happy Coding!
